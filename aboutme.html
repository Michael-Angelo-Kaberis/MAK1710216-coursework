          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hey, in this part I'm going to be telling you about myself, this is getting weirdly meta btw.
            I'm going to sum it up really quick and if for some reason you need more feel free to scroll further down.
            So, I'm an 18 year old Greek kid that grew up in an island with DC WB cartoons and rock music. Narurally I started reading comics, playing games, picked up the guitar and started drawing.
            Now for the CV part, which is probably going to be more bland and uninteresting than a Nickelback concert.</p>

            <h1> MY CV</h1>
            <p> My name is Michail Angelos Kaberis, I was born October 5th 1999 and I come from Rhodes, Greece. I am a self-tought artist/illustrator hellbent on drawing comics. Very capable with pencil, pen and watercolour.</p>
            <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
            <p>In my years on this earth I have graduated highschool with honours, I have 2 English proficiency degrees, and a degree in German. I have studied sculpture for a year with a local master and have a decade of guitar playing experience under my belt, mostly proficient in playing the blues and rock</p>
            <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <p>A jack of all trades and master of some, in my teenage years I delved a lot in extracurricular team activities such as sports and playing in bands.
              I led a local football team in my early teenage years and my place of choice was and still is defender.
              Later I took up kayaking almost making it to the K2 nationals. After that I took up swimming making it to the nationals of 4 people mixed open seas swimming, coming in 5th.
              I was also a member of 2 bands (in the same time) as both a guitarist and a bassist.
              As for work, I worked on and off for a decade in my family's coffee shop(oldest on the island and one of the oldest in Greece) as a salesperson basically, but have also been left responsible for the shop on my own on more than plenty occasions.</p>
